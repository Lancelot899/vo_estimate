mode 1:
- use multisense laser at horizontal (both sensor and SL) to estimate motion in xy yaw
  - Why? to demostrate scanmatching and to do a little kintinuous at scale
- use a laser bolted onto the multisense to estimate motion in xy and yaw
  - Why? to demostrate scanmatching and to do a little kintinuous but also to build a 3D model with lidar

- produce an estimate at the laser scan but publish a position estimate at the body frame

mode 2:
- have the lidar tilted and estimate the motion with low drift for a few cm
  - 
- also look at the cmu estimator too




currently estimate pose of a lidar
- want to support a lidar - any lidar
- and then theough frames, get the pose of the body frame
